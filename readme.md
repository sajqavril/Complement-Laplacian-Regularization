# A Reminder for CLAR Repository

We publicize the essential three Python files for a better understanding of our submission and to ensure reproducibility.

- train_reg.py: The entrance of our project, where the annotates for the regularization methods are essential.
- utils.py: It includes data-processing functions, and all the regularization methods, e.g., MADReg, P_reg, CLAR_reg, etc.
- model.py: All the baselines are reproduced in this file.
